## *Neural Style Transfer*: 
  *- A cool deeplearning architecture that uses already trained model to create artistic images ðŸ˜€.*
  
  *- It's not your regular pixel manipluating model. let's imagine if you give a human(artist) a image(content image) and a style (style image), 
    then you want the new image that has the content of the your given image and style of the style image it what NST does ðŸ˜€*

   *- How it's do that? . By optimizing content and style representation in the trained model not new model don't you think it's cool. 
     if you wanna know more about https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576*

## *What i got*:
  *-I know it's not that good and not cool but **every pixel on the generated image is recreated not manipluated !***
